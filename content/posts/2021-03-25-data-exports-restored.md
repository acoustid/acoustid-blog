Daily JSON data exports are now available on https://data.acoustid.org/. They went down after the major problems on March 3rd.
Monthly and yearly aggregates, including full data exports will be available later in Q2 2021. I'll also try to make sure that
we have readily usable tools for importing these data exports into a database.
